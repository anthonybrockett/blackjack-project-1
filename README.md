# Blackjack (Also known as "21")

## Background

Fun Fact: The origin of the name "Blackjack" is commonly traced to casinos that were present in America's infancy that hosted a bonus that would pay out if a player had an Ace of Spades and a "Black" Jack (Jack of Clubs or Jack of Spades.)

Blackjack is one of the most well-known card games in the world, and it is likely due to the fact that when the rules are reduced to a singular idea it is simple: make 21. 

It should be mentioned that there are nuances in each variation of the game such as when a player can double down, hit, or surrender. Please see the Getting Started section for details on this iteration of Blackjack.

## Getting Started

[Let's Play Blackjack!](https://anthonybrockett.github.io/blackjack-project-1/)

In this game, a player will start with 1000 in their bank. First, the player will select the amount they would like to bet and click the Deal Hand button. Each hand will deal the player and the dealer 2 cards, with one of the dealer's cards being hidden. It is then the player's turn to decide if they would like the Hit, Stay, Surrender, or Double Down. After the player has ended their turn, the dealer will play their hand using a predetermined set of rules (see house rules). Once the dealer ends their turn, the hands will be compared to determine the winner. Upon resolution of the hand, the player may make another bet to deal a new hand.

Note: If the player busts, or if either the player or dealer gets blackjack, the hand automatically ends.

### House Rules:
1. The Dealer must hit on soft 17
2. Player may double down on any 2 cards less than hard 19 and up to soft 20
3. Player may not stay on any hand less than hard 12
4. Player may not hit on any hand greater than hard 19
5. Player may surrender on any 2 cards other than blackjack

### Useful Terms
**Hit:** Take another card <br>
**Stay:** Keep current cards and pass the turn to the dealer <br>
**Surrender:** Forfeit the hand and take back half of the current bet <br>
**Double Down:** Double the current bet, but only be allowed to take a single card <br>
**Blackjack:** Ace + Card of Value 10 (10's and Face Cards) - Pays 6:5 <br>
**Hard:** Hand can only be assigned one value <br>
**Soft:** Hand has the option of 2 values
